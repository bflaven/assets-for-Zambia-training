## 1. How to increase the site speed of an existing website? (part 1)

In part one of the series, we will present in detail optimization and apply what we've just learned. We will learn how to diagnose, to minify and leverage manually on key factors to grab speed for an existing website.

## 2. How to start a WP theme creation, integrating the best practices for optimization and speed, based on Gulp? (part 2)

If you are tired to buy a theme on some market place and feel ready to start your own WP theme from scratch then this post is for you. You'd better integrate at the very beginning some of the best practices so your theme will be web speed compliant. In part two of the series, we will explore how to build a theme with the help of Gulp.

## 3. NOTES

- **NOTE 1:** According to me, you can can read independently part 1 and part 2 because the same concepts (optimization, minify...etc.) are used but with different purposes and in different manners.

- **NOTE 2:** Just to prove my degree of involvement, I am the first guinea pig for my experiments on website optimization. I am testing on 2 websites:
    - My personal blog: <a href="http://flaven.fr/" target="_blank">http://flaven.fr/</a> 
    - Use the website for experiments: <a href="http://dev-test-bf-wp.pantheonsite.io/" target="_blank">http://dev-test-bf-wp.pantheonsite.io/</a>
