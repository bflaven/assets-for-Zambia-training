##  1_4 Leveraging on FMM's experience : successes and failures

Here are few keywords that can summarize what I have been mostly learning by doing. I always tried to withdraw some knowledge from my own experiences, that is the main reason of my personal Blog: to keep track of any experiment and collect Best Practices.

### Do not forget User Experience
Never forget the publishing or user experience. WordPress is one of the best starting point to achieve a great content management. It can even be fun.

### KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)
Solutions maybe be complexed but code, tools, processes, systems, and practices must be as simple as possible. Simplicity facilitates collaboration as there is a lower barrier of entry. 

### Standardization
For any activity related to the web or the mobile, to improve efficiency it is necessary to standardize what you are using and how you use it. WordPress does not escape to this rule.

You can think about standardization as a way of organizing your work with strong guidance by using tools, frameworks, libraries, style, version control, and even languages. It saves time, speeds up your work and enable to share your knowledge with your team.

### Constant learning
Technology watch is a good habit as the web is an incredible learning resource. You can keep an eye on markets and new innovations so your knowledge is not set in stone and will probably change.

### Failure
Make practical attempts and do not gather too much theoretical knowledge. You should not be afraid to practice even if it is leading to a failure. Failure is a prerequisite to learning. Remember if you fail, fail cheap, fail fast!
