## 1_2 3 things you want to learn in this Class, the method. <a href="README.md">&#8592;</a><br>

A FMM, we tackled the digital transformation since 3 years now, a serious move from waterfall to agile in digital project management. So basically, we always wonder what can be learned from the others and we always give R.O.T.I (Return On Time Invested) to what we are currently doing.

**(i) What is a R.O.T.I?**

The R.O.T.I is to evaluate the return on time invested, at the end of a meeting, a workshop, a training session on a scale of 1 to 5 by having each participant vote by a show of hands.

- 5 fingers: Excellent. It was worth more than the time we spent there
- 4 fingers: Good. I won more than the time I spent there
- 3 fingers: Just Average. I did not waste my time, no more,
- 2 fingers: Useful but it was not worth 100% the time I spent there,
- 1 finger: Not useful. I did not win anything, nothing learned.

**(ii) Food for thoughts**
- What are the 3 things you may want to learn in the training session?
- Do not hesitate to give a ROTI at the end of each session.

> learn-it-all beats know-it-all

**(iii) I am also a guinea pig!**

For me, it was the occasion to do 3 things :

1. Step back and give a big picture (practices, know-how, culture) of the Digital Department I am working in FMM.
2. Achieve the collaboration with Academie from FMM. This training in Digital is a premiere !
3. On more personal point of view, make a skills assessment what I known about WP (editorials, marketing, technics) and by extension on Digital.
