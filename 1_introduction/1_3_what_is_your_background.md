far.

### 1. What I need to know about General background?

Maybe you can provide me general information about ZNBC, Zambia People concerns, the Way We Consume News

**What I need to know about you?**<br>
I need more information about you... Maybe, we can play a little bit.

### 2. About you?
I can propose you 2 ways of presenting yourself.

2.1 The "straightforward" way &#9775;?

- Name, Function, Small Bio, Current Working Projects.

2.2 The "fun" way &#9731;?

- **10 words that define me**<br>
Each participant writes a word on a post it and put it on the wall. Then, each participant chooses the words that define themselves

- **Truth or Lie**<br>
Everyone says 3 truths and 3 lies about themselves and people need to guess.
