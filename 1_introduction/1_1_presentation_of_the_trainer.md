**(ii) In FMM**

I started in FMM in July 2013.

I worked as project manager for redesigning websites responsive around the first API's version and implementing also a SSO (Single-Sign-On) solution.

Currently, I am the project manager in France Media Monde (FMM) mostly on mobile applications (iOS and Android). 

I worked as a PO for a more specific Backoffice named Cockpit integrating micro web-services e.g  Authentication management on Users, Roles, and Permissions Animation an on-line JSON editor to manage mobile applications, connected TV and website.


I am also backup/binomial of the new FMM editorial back-office made with Symfony.
