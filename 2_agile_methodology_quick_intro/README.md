# In the midst of Agile Methodology

A short introduction about the agility and with a mix of advices, practices, return on experience... And always few basic takeaways.

**<a href="#agile_1">1. Behind the scene** &#8595;</a><br>


<a id="agile_1"></a>
## 1. Behind the scene

**Time is at Storytelling, in addition to language's elements, there are plenty of artefacts that promote and inseminate agile values in a team.**

This is the purpose of the list below. What does these heterogeneous elements reveal? It is important to vary and mix the modes of communication from visual to linguistic and even corporal. Why? Because we are as individuals both identical and singular and all these individuals make up a team.

Unfortunately or fortunately, the relevance of a message is only measured by its adoption and therefore its performance, that is to say by the effect it produces. It is therefore important to define some synthetic "mantra" which describe in a few words the objectives pursued or the shared values.

Without freaking the caricature however, do not announce the 5 key rules of management and give only 4 or 6. This is a mess.

**Create a narrative or "mantra" for how infusing growth mindset traits in your culture can accelerate transformation. Develop language (for example, "learn-it-all beats know-it-all") that you routinely use in meetings and key change situations.**

## 2. Play Agile
Let's gave the same short job description for project management from 2 different perspectives or mindsets.

**With a Waterfall perspective**

> My job is to make project management, with a stressed mindset, to deliver after a 6 months development process a deprecated and untested product and then being stopped for depression ruined by failure and fear of failure.

**With an Agile perspective**
> My job is to make project management by dealing with complexity and realities in uncertainty, with a playful mindset, thus delivering value with repeated short iterations each ended by a product demo and deliver by the end a product that I am proud of.

Be honest, the truth is in between!


## 3. Some definitions for Agile Rituals (Scrum)

**Let's focus only on agile rituals definitions that are commonly used in Scrum.**

- `Sprint`: 
- `Ritual`: 
- `Retro`: 
- `Daily`: 
- `Sprint Planning`:

## 4. Boards
You can use boards, where at a glance, you can visualize the progress of any project. You can find plentuy of models on the web to get columns names and define your own logic that fit to your needs.


**A board can be a quite sophisticated and organised that reflects your work-flow**
![A board can be a quite sophisticated and organised that reflects your work-flow](images/boards/2_agile_methodology_quick_intro_agile_working_board_small.jpg)


**A board with on the right events coming up like Retro, Demo...etc.**
![A board with on the right events coming up like Retro, Demo...etc.](images/boards/1_agile_methodology_quick_intro_agile_transition_how_create_offline_board_small.jpg)

 Always try to associate Form and Substance. Here is a example of Virtuous Circle for Scrum Values.

**Or you can use Board as Values Reminder**
![Or you can use Board as Values Reminder](images/boards/3_agile_methodology_quick_intro_improve_virtuous_circle_scrum_values_small.jpg)


## 5. Graphic facilitation
One of my favourite occupation that goes pretty well with the previous point. It goes on paper-board, scrapbook...etc. Very easy to initiate, do not think you cannot draw.

**You can use it in meetings, training, notes taking. The visual content thus created becomes itself the support of the discussion or the formation. Nothing is lost, nothing is created: everything is transformed**

### 5.1 How, Where and When ?

**During a meeting as speech facilitator**<br>
*Help you out to position yourself in a retro for instance*
![During a meeting as speech facilitator](images/graphic_facilitation/1_agile_methodology_quick_intro_graphic_facilitation_word_cloud.png)

**Advantages of drawing over other tools, more "plastic"**

Why is there advantages of storyboarding before development on the other tools for instance tool like PPT ?<br>

**Here is a beginning of answer: reflection & thoughts are most of time non-linear. Drawing is a key element for storytelling. Drawing combines more easily errors, shortcuts, reversals that are the reflection and creativity essentials.**<br>

### 5.3 Be humble start step by step

You have fundamentals form that can help you out in order to project your ideas on paper support.

**Play with fundamentals**<br><br>

### 5.4 Let's do it together, pick up a form and do the try-it-yourself

**Game 1: Keep in form**<br>
*Draw basic forms to start with graphic facilitation*<br>
![Game 1: Keep in form](images/graphic_facilitation/2_agile_methodology_quick_intro_graphic_facilitation_word_clouds_bikablo_small.jpg)

**Game 2: Oh, please, Draw Me A Sheep!  No, I will draw a banner!**<br>
*Add some banner to your board or your notes*<br>
![Game 2: Oh, please, Draw Me A Sheep!  No, I will draw a banner!](images/graphic_facilitation/4_agile_methodology_quick_intro_visual_notes_banners_small.jpg)


**Game 3: The Roy Lichtenstein Contest**<br>
*Let's play with words and emphasize intentions with the fonts like in Comic Books*<br>

## 6. Wireframing
A very helpful way of presenting user stories to anyone: developers, PO, stakeholders. It is a time saver as you are trying to bring to life a user experience.

There is a lot a SAAS or online tools or you can pickup one of the major tool below. The list is far from being an exhaustive list! As there is a tool that


### 6.1 Online applications<br>

- Wireframe.cc<br><a href="https://wireframe.cc/" target="_blank">https://wireframe.cc/</a>

*Just type "online wireframe and mockup tool" in Google and you can make your choice!*

### 6.2 Softwares<br>
These software are sometime pretty sophisticated and have a learning curb it is like video editing. Avoid the multiple purpose tool.
My favourite Balsamiq even though it is is in Flash.

### 6.3 Spotlight on Sketch<br>

Sketch is a rare gem and combined with Craft, a cleverly plugin developed by Invisionapp, it become almost a killer application.

The combination is here to promote the horizontal integration of their platform with the two most popular software for Sketch and Photoshop screen design. It is certain that what is emerging is the winning combination for the creation of applications including: Sketch, Craft, Invisionapp.

**If, in this combination, you add a tool like Jira in project management, then you will have in your hands what is currently best in the creation and the most agile management possible.**

My favourite element in the Sketch software is the ability to "clone" content and/or "plug" external sources to give more credibility to your models, to make them more attractive to all: PO, Stakeholders, Graphic Designers, Developers etc.

### 6.4 Some real work situations<br>
Some images from real experiences from website mock-up or wp plugin mock-up.

**Elements for Wireframing with Balsamiq**<br>

**All elements to illustrate Funnel scenario or an Epic, that aggregate User Storie**<br>
![Wireframing with Balsamiq](images/wireframing_sketch/3_agile_methodology_quick_wireframing.jpg)

**Designed before developed : a WP plugin designed first with Balsamiq**<br>

*This plugin really existed. It was part of end-to-end exercise for crafting a WordPress plug-in from mock-up to field-name description, going through coding and even including a gherkin feature in order to offer the best user experience.

**Output: The same screen developed in Symfony**<br>

*This work can be done even though the API web services needed to operate this screen are not ready. It is a functional milestone not a technical one!*

## 7. Gherkin<br>

The gherkin can be used for headless or browser functional testing. For instance, a successful combination can be made with Browserstack, Symfony and Mink to make functional testing.

**Gherkin is also a pretty good way to avoid blurred description in application features or to describe user story even though the features will not be run. It can be used in WordPress or for an API.**

An excerpt from Dan North's blog about the importance of behavior-driven development (BDD).

> It has evolved out of established agile practices and is designed to make them more accessible and effective for teams new to agile software delivery. Over time, BDD has grown to encompass the wider picture of agile analysis and automated acceptance testing.

### 7.1 A gherkin feature for an API<br>

## 8. Feedback on Agility, few key things to remember<br>

**This is not again a full lesson on Agility or on Scrum but just few key elements really experimented at FMM throughout the Digital Transformation Process that have imply a move from Waterfall to Agile. Here is few agile practices on 3 concrete aspects on change management**

### 8.1 Manage interactions

**(i) Search of the essential**<br>
Listen, listen to each other, and ask themselves questions about your work's impact. **Give yourself the right not to perform a task that adds nothing in terms of value or effectiveness or whose cost time is greater than the expected profit.**

**(ii) Being emotionally close to his teams**<br>
Distance is not a problem if you are emotionally close to your teams. The important thing is to communicate well and to follow up emotions/needs of the teams. **The subjective impression of the project is in itself an objective indicator of the health of the project.**

**(iii) I will be your worst nightmare**<br>
In case of conflict between 2 teams: how to defuse confrontation? A serious game can be made: Have the worst situation described to two opposing teams. The exchange must be done in a CNV (Non-violent Communication) spirit

### 8.2 Achieve

**(i) Deliver what is ready**<br>
How long have completed features been waiting to be put into production? The objective is to discover the prioritization by the value and to favour the finished work.

**It highlights the importance of "Lead Time"**<br>
The "Lead Time" is actually the time that elapses between the beginning of a process and its end. It corresponds for example, the time that will take a development team to deliver a new feature on an application.

It is a very good metric on organization efficiency for a team. This aspect can be improved by numerous optimization searches in order to respond as quickly as possible to external or internal requests e.g pizzeria story.

### 8.3 Manage interactions

**(i) Save time for learning**<br>
In Lean never exceed 80% of resource use. Why not do the same and keep 20% of the time to learn and improve? With Katas, Dojos, code experiments or products? Constantly improve the team, the products and oneself, while not "overuse" the "resources" and thus improving the flow e.g Zambia training.

**(ii) Set a goal**<br>
Agility rhymes with simplicity but simple does not want with simplistic!
**A simple solution is not a simplistic solution. A simple and well-designed solution will be easy to evolve and maintain.** The target remains effectiveness e.g Cockpit.

**(iii) Work on a single metric**<br>
View and work on one indicator at a time. Identify a success indicator adapted to your project and its stage of progress. Change it when you reach your goal or as your project evolves. **This allows the entire team to make the right decisions, join forces to achieve the same goal and measure the impact of their efforts.** The objective is to focus on what is really important today e.g Image vs Performance in BO2.

## 9. Culture hack and Mindset, a step forward in Digital Transformation

**A very quick introduction to the concepts Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset to accelerate digital transformation.**

Different mindsets can trigger vastly divergent responses in two individuals to the same change situation. Threat or reward? Fight or flight? Just consider skilled and competent people facing a move out of their comfort zones.

The implicit question behind this question is how mindsets invisibly shape responses to change ? Imagine that all of us are a mixed of Growth Mindset and Fixed Mindset.

### 9.1 How individually answer to the change ?

Few practical advices, full of common sense, to individually behave towards changes.

- **Adopt new language:**"learn fast" rather than "fail fast". Instead of thinking that you have "failed" consider that you have "not yet" mastered the required skills.
- **Role-model learning and vulnerability:** People realize "it's OK not to know, but it's not OK not to learn. "learn-it-all beats know-it-all"

- **Confess one's ignorance:** You must combat perfectionism (a fixed mindset trait), where workers often fear appearing weak by low mastery of a skill.  The reward systems must recognize learning, not just performance.

- **No fear of failure:** It is a fixed mindset trait. It is failure that gives you the proper perspective on success.

### 9.2 Collectively practice the cultural hack
As a group, culture hack are opportunities to foster a culture where teams can lean into transformation together and experiment team-working.

The cultural hack has L.I.V.E characteristics.

- **L for Low-effort:** The hack should be easy to execute. It should take less than 48 hours to design and execute a hack. If your hack requires more than 10 people and three months to carry out, it's not a hack. But be sure to do not no confuse low effort with low courage.

- **I for Immediate:** It has to be made in 24 ou 48 hours not in 3 months. Think about the correlation between lead-time, impact and efficiency.

- **V for Visible:** The change should be visible to everyone in a meeting room (Boards), say, or everyone copied on an email.

- **E for Emotional:** The hack should incite a visceral reaction. Change is primarily an emotional process, not an analytical one, so the most efficient way to promote it is by using feelings, not facts.
